# Challenge03
For this challenge I was given a generate password button but it had no functionality when clicked.
I was able to accomplish creating the prompts when the generate button was clicked and I set up a few questions to be answered to determine how your password was going to be generated.
First you will click the generate password button and it will ask you for a password length that must be between 8 and 128 characters long. 
Then the further questions will be would you like uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters. You will press ok for yes and cancel for no.
Once you have completed all prompts you will be generated a new password based on your selections.
